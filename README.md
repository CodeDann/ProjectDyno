# ProjectDyno
My A Level CS project.

A website with a SQL server backend building using the WAMP framework.

This allowed for students to log into the website and access lectures that teachers had uploaded for them to watch.
Teachers could also log in to upload content (documents / videos) for their students to have access to.


Built January 2020
